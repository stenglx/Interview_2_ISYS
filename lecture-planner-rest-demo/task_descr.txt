1) Implement the feature requests:
* add a feature to delete lectures
* add a feature to delete employee and his/her lectures
* add corresponding MockMvc test cases (in the REST services)

2) Generate API documentation:
* create the openAPI documentation of the versions (before and after 
implementing the two previous features) and diff them using openAPI tools
* analyze whether the implementations of the two feature requests are "API 
breaking"?

3) Implement the feature change request:
* an employee can teach max. 2 lectures. Modify the lecture service 
accordingly and also add a test case for that.
* analyze the impact of this change within and across potentially affected 
services
